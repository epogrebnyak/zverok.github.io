* [Blog](/blog/) is full of rants about Ruby, RSpec, my projects and development in general;
* [Good Value Object Conventions](https://github.com/zverok/good-value-object) is an RFC-alike document for Ruby Value Objects;
* [Participant](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/users/710) of Ruby language development discussions (I'm that guy who invented `Kernel#then`, so sue me), and committer of documentation improvements to Ruby and its standard library.
